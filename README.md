Data-Coder
==========

An in-browser tool to facilitate manual coding of qualitative data.


***This project is currently just a mock-up.***

The current mock-up attempts to create a data-coding interface which can be easily 
customized from data-set to data-set, session to session (either remotely or through 
information embeded in the data-set).
